# torrnavigator-app
A easy and simple navigator for RARBG database, might be a bit clunky because it was rushed and has a lot of room for improvement

It is made in electron, because my first tought was to make it a webpage that everyone could use without tech knowledge. And then it came to me what about electron that way it is a webpage that can run on any pc and does not require fancy setups

I do not usually code in electron so beaware of bad code. I also used the default dashboard sample from boostrap.

Hope you enjoy.
